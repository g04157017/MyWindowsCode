    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     34
      Number with same-slice register load:     31
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   154 out of   3,758    4%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       148 out of   7,516    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          482
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           151 out of     482   31%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             115 out of  30,064    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
